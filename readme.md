Igeo Demo
=========

This is a very small monkey-patch library I developed to add a Demo
Mode to the Igeo Library (tested with Processing 1.5.1) 

### About

[Igeo](http://igeo.jp/) is a very powerful tool for Generative 3D Design + Architecture.
It featues a Development Mode ( 4 panels with different perspectives )
with a lot of special keys for navigation, saving the geometry etc.

If you just need to demo your sketch this may not be what you want.
This sketch demonstrates how to use the Kiosk-Mode and how to customize 
the look and feel of the Graphics.


### Features

- All IGEO Key-Commands disabled
- Switching Perspectives disabled

### Install

- Download the `.zip` file
